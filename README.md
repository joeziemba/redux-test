# Understanding Redux

## Reducers
- Live in and are **used by the Redux store** (never directly interacts with the app components)
- Control how/when state is updated based on actions dispatched
- Take State and Action as arguments
- Define the schema(s) of the global state object in "initialState" (see messageReducer.js)
- Determine namespaces of the state object when pulled into `combineReducers()` (see rootReducer.js)

## Actions
- Are hash objects generated by Action Creator functions
- Should contain a type (used by the reducer to trigger a state update)
- Should contain the new values that will be added to state by the reducers

## Action Creators
- Functions that generate action objects
- Are **imported into actual components** to allow them to interact with the Store and update state.
- Are mapped to props wrapped in the dispatch function
- REPLACE `this.setState()` functionality
